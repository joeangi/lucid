# Lucid

**A Material 3 Expressive desktop shell for Hyprland, built on [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org).**

A bar, a dock that morphs into a launcher, desktop widgets, a lock screen,
an emoji picker, a screenshot tool and a settings app — themed together from
your wallpaper.

## Install

Lucid installs to `~/.config/quickshell` and needs **Arch Linux or Fedora** and
**Hyprland**. Three commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sn3akyy1/lucid.git
cd lucid
./install.sh
```

### Fedora

The installer supports conventional DNF-based Fedora installations; Fedora
Atomic desktops require manual setup. Install Hyprland before running Lucid
and log into a Hyprland session. Lucid does not run as a GNOME or KDE shell.
The bundled Lua configuration needs Hyprland 0.55 or newer; use `--no-hypr`
to keep your existing configuration.

Fedora's required packages are `quickshell`, `qt6-qt5compat`,
`qt6-qtdeclarative` and `qt6-qtmultimedia`. The installer checks installed
packages with RPM and resolves missing packages using
[DNF repoquery](https://dnf5.readthedocs.io/en/stable/commands/repoquery.8.html).
Package availability depends on your Fedora release and enabled repositories.
If a required package is missing, install it before launching the shell.

Optional tools and dock apps missing from your repositories are reported for
manual installation. Fedora uses `ffmpeg-free` (or an installed `ffmpeg`);
available recording codecs depend on that build. The bundled look uses
JetBrainsMono Nerd Font; Fedora's `jetbrains-mono-fonts` supplies the base font,
so install the Nerd Font separately for all prompt glyphs. `--skip-deps` skips
package installation but **still installs Lucid and changes configuration**.

### Installer steps

That's it — the installer does the rest:

1. **Checks your system** — refuses to run anywhere it can't finish the job,
   rather than leaving you half-installed.
2. **Installs dependencies** — uses `pacman` and `paru`/`yay` on Arch, or
   `dnf` on Fedora. It lists everything and asks before touching your system.
   Say no and it carries on, telling you which features won't work.
   This includes the apps Lucid ships pinned to the dock — potentially several
   GB. On Fedora, packages unavailable in enabled repositories are listed and
   skipped; no additional repositories are enabled. `--no-apps` skips dock apps.
3. **Copies the shell** to `~/.config/quickshell`, moving any existing config to
   `~/.config/quickshell.backup-<timestamp>` first.
4. **Sets up Hyprland** — `hyprland.lua` and its modules: the keybinds, the
   window and layer rules, blur, animations, and an autostart that launches the
   shell on login. If you already have a config it is backed up and you are
   asked first; `--no-hypr` keeps yours untouched.
5. **Sets up theming** — the palettes, the wallpaper hook, and the matugen
   template. An existing `matugen/config.toml` is appended to, never replaced.
6. **Applies the look** — kitty's colours, its opacity and its fish shell, the
   starship prompt (wired into `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` and `config.fish`), the
   VSCode/VSCodium Matugen theme, and the GTK theme: `adw-gtk3-dark` with the
   FairyWren icons, written to `gsettings` and to both `gtk-3.0` and `gtk-4.0`
   `settings.ini`.
   `--no-look` skips this.
7. **Pins the dock** — reads your installed `.desktop` files and pins the real
   apps, so the dock is never a row of blank letter tiles.
8. **Offers to restart** a running instance onto the new files.

Then reload Hyprland so the new binds and rules take effect:

```sh
hyprctl reload
```

Or log out and back in, which picks up the autostart too. To start the shell by
hand in the meantime, run `qs`.

Set a wallpaper from **Settings → General** on first run — that's what generates
your colour palette.

### Updating

Pull and re-run. Your settings, pinned apps, reminders, Shazam history and API
keys are carried forward into the new install:

```sh
git pull
./install.sh
```

Lucid tells you when there is something to pull. Once a day it asks GitHub's
public API for the newest release, and when that is newer than the version you
installed it posts one notification — once per version, never again for the same
one. The request is a plain `curl` for
`api.github.com/repos/Sn3akyy1/lucid/releases/latest` and carries nothing about
you or your machine; **Settings → About** shows what it found and turns it off.

```sh
qs ipc call updates status   # what it knows
qs ipc call updates check    # ask now
```

### Older versions

`v0.57 beta` is a tag, so it stays exactly where it is:

```sh
git clone --branch v0.57 https://github.com/Sn3akyy1/lucid.git
```

It is on the [releases page](https://github.com/Sn3akyy1/lucid/releases)
too, as a source archive. Nothing carries over between the two — v1.0.0 moved
enough that it is worth installing fresh.

### Installer options

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--no-theming` | Skips the palette layer. Leaves `~/.config/lucid` and `~/.config/matugen` alone — use this if you already have a matugen setup you don't want touched. |
| `--no-hypr` | Keeps your Hyprland config. Lucid's binds, window rules, blur and autostart are not installed. |
| `--no-apps` | Doesn't install the apps the dock ships pinned (Zen, VSCodium, Spotify, Vesktop, Files, Steam, Proton VPN). The dock then pins whatever equivalents you already have. |
| `--no-look` | Doesn't touch `kitty.conf`, `starship.toml`, your shell rc files, VSCode settings, or the GTK theme and icons. |
| `--no-wallpapers` | Doesn't copy the bundled wallpapers into `~/Pictures/wallpapers`. They are ~180 MB, so this is worth passing on a small disk or a slow link. |
| `--with-hypr` | Reinstalls Lucid's Hyprland config even when one is already in place. |
| `--skip-deps` | Never installs packages, just reports what's missing. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Accept every prompt. |

Re-running the installer is how you update. It moves your existing
`~/.config/quickshell` to `~/.config/quickshell.backup-<timestamp>`, installs
the new shell files, then carries your settings, pinned apps, reminders,
Shazam history and API keys forward into it. Nothing is deleted, and the
backup stays where it is until you remove it.

## Keybinds

The installer ships these in `~/.config/hypr/modules/binds.lua`, along with the
window rules, blur, animations and the autostart. Run `hyprctl reload` after
installing to pick them up.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPER` (tap) | Launcher |
| `SUPER` + `P` | Command palette |
| `SUPER` + `T` | Theme picker |
| `SUPER` + `B` | Wallpaper picker |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `V` | Clipboard history |
| `SUPER` + `S` | Settings |
| `SUPER` + `.` | Emoji picker |
| `SUPER` + `K` | On-screen keyboard |
| `SUPER` + `W` | Workspace overview (also: three-finger swipe) |
| `SUPER` + `D` / `Print` | Region screenshot |
| `SUPER` + `Print` | Full screenshot |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `T` | Copy text from a region (OCR) |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `C` | Pick a colour off the screen |
| `SUPER` + `E` | Files |
| `SUPER` + `C` | Close window |
| `SUPER` + `V` | Toggle float |
| `SUPER` + `1`–`0` | Switch workspace (`+SHIFT` moves the window) |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `S` | Scratchpad, or put away whichever special workspace is up |
| `SUPER` + `ALT` + `S` | Stash the focused window in the scratchpad, or send it back |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `M` | Music workspace |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `D` | Comms workspace |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `R` | To-do workspace |
| `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `Esc` | System monitor workspace |
| `SUPER` + arrows | Move focus |
| `SUPER` + `R` | Reload Hyprland |
| `F1`–`F6` | Volume, mic, brightness |
| `F9` | Terminal |
| `F10` | Lock |
| `F12` | Calculator |

Ran with `--no-hypr`, or want to bind things yourself? Everything is exposed
over IPC:

```
bind = SUPER, SPACE,  exec, qs ipc call -- launcher toggle
bind = SUPER, E,      exec, qs ipc call -- moji toggle
bind = SUPER, L,      exec, qs ipc call -- lock lock
bind = SUPER, S,      exec, qs ipc call -- snap toggle
bind = SUPER SHIFT, T, exec, qs ipc call -- snap text
bind = SUPER SHIFT, C, exec, qs ipc call -- snap color
bind = SUPER, comma,  exec, qs ipc call -- settings open
```

Special workspaces are Hyprland Lua rather than IPC. On a Lua config of your
own, copy `support/hypr/modules/specials.lua` into `~/.config/hypr/modules/`
and bind its functions the way Lucid's `modules/binds.lua` does:

```lua
local specials = require("modules.specials")
hl.bind("SUPER + SHIFT + M", specials.toggle("music"))
```

Keep the `--`. It is only strictly required when the call takes an argument —
`qs ipc call settings show bar` fails with *"The following argument was not
expected: bar"*, while `qs ipc call -- settings show bar` works. It is harmless
on argument-free calls, so using it everywhere saves you the surprise.

## What's in it

### Bar

Six modules, each a pill that expands into a panel. Every one can be turned
off in Settings.

- **Workspaces** — live window previews per workspace, click to switch.
  Scratchpads (special workspaces) sit beside the dots as a greyed chip marked
  with a glyph for what is stashed in them — a terminal for a terminal, a note
  for an editor, read off each app's own categories. Opening one sinks the dots,
  fans the glyphs out and lifts them into the accent with its name. Click a
  glyph to jump to that window, or drag windows in and out from the overview's
  scratchpad row
- **Media** — MPRIS controls, seek bar, art, and Shazam-style song ID (`songrec`)
- **Tray** — SNI system tray with working context menus
- **Clock** — calendar, weather, and reminders that toast when they're due
- **Notifications** — grouped by application, with inline reply for chat apps
  and progress bars for transfers. New ones stack under the bar, the newest
  growing out of the pill itself; do-not-disturb holds them back
- **System** — volume, brightness, battery, disk stats and a Caffeine tile,
  plus full Wi-Fi and Bluetooth panels and a switcher for the audio output and
  input. Hover any icon on the compact strip and it names itself

Two shapes, set in Settings: **island** (floating rounded pills) or **notch**
(flush to the screen edge, with flares that blend into it).

<img src="assets/prev4.webp" alt="The System panel: toggles, sliders, media, and system stats">

*The System pill opens into a control centre — Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with full
panels behind them, quick toggles like Caffeine and Do Not Disturb, brightness
and volume with the audio devices behind those, what is playing, and CPU, RAM,
battery and per-disk usage.*

### Dock and launcher

A floating M3 toolbar that grows into the launcher rather than opening a
second window over it. Pinned apps, running-window indicators, drag to
reorder, optional magnification and auto-hide.

The launcher is one search field over six modes:

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Apps | Fuzzy search over `.desktop` entries — word boundaries and initials both hit, so `vsc` finds Visual Studio Code |
| Commands | Shell commands and shell actions |
| Theme | Switch between the seven bundled palettes, and any you have imported |
| Wallpaper | Carousel of your wallpaper folder |
| Power | Lock, log out, suspend, reboot, shut down, hibernate |
| Clipboard | What you copied earlier, images included — pick one to put it back on the clipboard |

Type `=` in the search field for a calculator (`=2^3^2`, right-associative).

Clipboard mode keeps what you copy and hands it back: pick an entry to put it
back on the clipboard, `Delete` (or the button on the row) to drop one, and
*Clear history* on the Dock settings page to drop the lot. Images are kept too
and preview in the row. `cliphist` is the store; the shell owns the `wl-paste`
watchers that feed it, so history records for as long as the shell is running.
Turn the whole thing off with the switch on the Dock page.

<img src="assets/prev2.webp" alt="The wallpaper carousel inside the launcher">

*Wallpaper mode: a carousel that previews as you move through it, and applies
on the second press.*

### Desktop widgets

Cards you place on the wallpaper yourself. Open **Settings → Widgets**, click a
tile, and it lands on the desktop; drag it anywhere, pin it so it stops moving,
and it comes back where you left it after a reboot.

<img src="assets/prev5.webp" alt="Clock, calendar, to-do and note widgets on a lakeside wallpaper, with the volume popup above the dock">

*A clock, the month, a to-do list and a sticky note, with the volume popup
showing above the dock and a visualiser running under it.*

Eleven kinds, thirty-three looks between them — every category ships several
variants of the same data:

| Widget | Looks |
| --- | --- |
| Clock | Digital, stacked, analog, minimal (no card at all), world clock across three cities |
| Calendar | Full month, this week, today |
| System | Arc gauges, meters, a two-minute graph, or a bare row of numbers — CPU, memory, disk and temperature |
| Battery | Ring, cell, or the full detail with time left and draw |
| Media | Artwork card, compact row, or cover art with the controls over it |
| Visualiser | Bars, mirrored bands, or one filled wave — live off whatever is playing. Drag any edge to size it, right across the screen if you want |
| Weather | Now, a four-day forecast, or an icon and a number — for the place set in Date & Time |
| Notes | A sticky square or a ruled sheet, saved as you type |
| To-do | A checklist or just what is still outstanding |
| Palette | The Material roles the shell is currently built from, click one to copy the hex |
| Phone | Card, compact row, or a remote — the paired phone's battery and signal, with ring, ping, send a file and send the clipboard a click away; the remote drives whatever the phone is playing |

Every widget has its own menu — right-click it, or use the gear that appears on
hover — for its style, its size, and its own options: 12- or 24-hour, which
metrics to show, °C or °F, a note's tint, and so on. Most take one of four
sizes; the visualiser instead grows an outline with handles when you hover it,
and you drag any edge or corner to whatever shape you want.

Dragging snaps to the screen edges and centre lines and lines up with the other
widgets, with guides while you drag. They can go anywhere on the screen,
including the strips the bar and the dock reserve — a full-width visualiser
tucked under the dock is the point. Widgets sit **below** your windows by
default so they behave like a desktop, and step aside for fullscreen windows;
both are switches on the Widgets page if you would rather they float on top.

### Special workspaces

Scratchpads that slide over whatever workspace you are on, and hide again with
the same keys.

| Keys | Workspace | Opens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `S` | Scratchpad | Nothing of its own — somewhere to park windows |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `M` | Music | Spotify, Feishin, Supersonic, Cider, YouTube Music, TIDAL… |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `D` | Comms | Discord, Vesktop, Telegram, Signal, Element, Slack… |
| `SUPER` + `SHIFT` + `R` | To-do | Todoist, Planify, Errands, Endeavour, Obsidian… |
| `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `Esc` | System | btop in a terminal, Mission Center, Resources… |

A key starts its workspace's app if it is not running, and pulls it back in if
you moved it somewhere else; opened from the launcher or the dock, the app lands
in its workspace too. `SUPER` + `ALT` + `S` stashes the focused window in the
scratchpad and, pressed inside a special workspace, sends it back. The
scratchpad key also puts away whichever workspace is up, so one key always
returns you to what you were doing.

**Settings → Workspaces** picks each one's apps, turns any of them off, and sets
how far the screen behind dims and whether switching workspace puts them away.
*Add an app* offers everything installed, not only the catalogue above, and
works out what to match its window by. It writes `~/.config/hypr/lucid-specials.lua`, which
`modules/specials.lua` reads on every key press, so a change applies without a
Hyprland reload.

### Everything else

- **Users and accounts** — the card at the top of the Settings rail opens a
  *Users and Accounts* page for every account on the machine: full name,
  username, account type, login shell, email and location, with the guards that
  matter — the last administrator cannot demote themselves and a signed-in
  account cannot be renamed. Set a password or have the account choose its own
  at the next sign-in, add and remove accounts, toggle supplementary groups, and
  pick a picture from the stock faces or any image. It all goes through
  AccountsService, so the shell's own polkit dialog does the asking and nothing
  runs as root
- **Account picture history** — changing your account picture keeps the old one
  on a shelf in the picker, newest first, so any picture you have worn is a
  click away. It holds twelve or 8 MB, drops the oldest as new ones arrive,
  files nothing twice, and can be emptied outright
- **Authentication prompts** — Lucid is the session's polkit agent, so every
  request for an administrator on the machine comes up in the shell's own
  dialog rather than KDE's. polkitd and PAM are still the backend; the dialog
  names the action, shows which account's password it wants (with the picture
  from the Users page) and lets you pick a different administrator when polkit
  will accept more than one
- **Lock screen** — a real `WlSessionLock` that checks the password through
  PAM, laid out the way Material You lays out a lock screen: an oversized
  two-line clock in the wallpaper's own colour, the weather, battery, network
  and Bluetooth at a glance, what is playing, the notifications and a power bar
  that asks before it logs you out. Start typing and it focuses — the wallpaper
  blurs further and everything but the sign-in card steps back. It counts your
  remaining tries against faillock, warns about Caps Lock, shows the keyboard
  layout, and will not let a notification launch anything while it is up
- **Login screen** — the lock screen ported to SDDM, so the machine looks like
  itself before you have signed in: the same clock, the same palette and the
  same wallpaper, blurred once in advance rather than on a cold GPU, with the
  user and session pickers where the glance chips sit. It is painted from the
  running shell's own colours, so it follows a theme change. The installer
  copies it in when SDDM is present but never switches to it — which theme
  greets you stays your call
- **On-screen keyboard** — `SUPER` + `K`, the desktop's right-click menu or the
  launcher's command list. It never takes the focus off what you are typing
  into, and clicks outside it reach the application underneath, so the caret
  stays where you put it. A letters layer and a function layer, modifiers that
  latch on one press and lock on two, and chords sent as chords. Drag it
  anywhere by the strip along its top and it stays there
- **Emoji picker** — emoji, kaomoji and GIFs (Giphy or Tenor), with recents,
  favourites and skin-tone variants; pastes into the focused window
- **Screenshots** — region select, full screen, and screen recording with
  optional mic and system audio
- **Text copier** — the *Text* mode in the screenshot toolbar. Drag a box over
  anything on screen — an image, a video still, a PDF, an error dialog, a
  window that will not let you select its text — and the words inside it land
  on your clipboard. Runs the crop through tesseract twice, once inverted, and
  keeps the better read, so light-on-dark UI text works as well as a scan.
  Emoji come across too: tesseract has none in its character set and either
  drops them or reads them as junk letters, so anything colourful and square
  is matched against the glyphs of your installed emoji fonts instead. One
  flat colour means text, many means emoji. A shape it cannot name is left
  out rather than guessed at. Reading takes a moment, so the overlay does not
  vanish on release: the toolbar, the shade and the box you drew all stay, and
  a beam sweeps the selection until the text is on the clipboard, at which
  point it closes itself. The result lands as a toast under the bar rather
  than a desktop notification -- screenshots keep theirs, because that one
  carries an "Open" action a toast cannot
- **Colour picker** -- the *Colour* mode hands off to `hyprpicker`. Choosing it
  drops the freeze, the shade and the crosshair and lets clicks through, so the
  toolbar is left floating over a live, usable desktop. Pick HEX, RGB or HSL,
  then hit the eyedropper: the toolbar stays up over hyprpicker, you click a
  pixel, and the value is copied and shown in a toast with the colour beside it.
  The output template is set per format, so the zoom lens, the clipboard and the
  toast all read the same and all three are valid CSS (`#RRGGBB`, `rgb(r, g, b)`,
  `hsl(h, s%, l%)`). Cancelling the pick leaves you on the toolbar;
  picking a colour ends the session. The toast shows the colour as itself rather than
  as an icon. hyprpicker is asked for raw components and the string is built
  here, so the swatch, the clipboard and the format all agree
- **Toasts** -- a compact pill under the bar for things that just need saying.
  Any script can raise one: `qs ipc call -- toast show game "Game Mode On"`,
  or `toast warn alert "..."` for the red variant. Named icons are `copy`,
  `check`, `alert`, `info`, `text`, `game` and `camera`; anything else is
  taken as a raw SVG path
- **Notifications** — a *Notifications* page for how they behave: whether
  popups appear at all, how long one stays and whether an application may set
  its own timeout, how much of the message and how many action buttons show,
  do-not-disturb with quiet hours between two times and a rule for fullscreen
  windows, a notification sound with its own volume, how many the list keeps,
  per-application muting, and switches for grouping by application, showing how
  long ago each arrived, progress bars, inline reply, and how many popups stack
  at once
- **OSD** — volume, brightness and microphone, each a badge and a level; Caps
  Lock and Num Lock get one too, showing the letters the next keystroke will
  make — `ABC` against `abc` — rather than the words on and off
- **Desktop** — drag across empty desktop and a translucent accent box follows
  the cursor, the way it does on Windows and macOS; it is cosmetic and selects
  nothing. Right-click the desktop for wallpaper, theme, your placed widgets,
  a screenshot and settings. Both are switches on the General page
- **Date and time** — a *Date & Time* page in Settings holds where the shell
  thinks it is. Turn on **Auto-detect location** — the same switch as the GPS
  tile in the bar's system panel — and your position is read from your network
  connection every few hours; leave it off and name a town yourself. One
  forecast is fetched for that position from
  [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) and shared by the bar clock, the lock
  screen and the weather widget, so the three can never disagree. The time zone
  on that page is the **machine's**, not a private one: picking a zone runs
  `timedatectl set-timezone` behind a polkit prompt, so every application on
  the box moves together and Lucid can never drift from the rest of your
  desktop. Switch on *Set it from my location* and a new position brings the
  zone with it. A program reads the zone once when it starts, so anything
  already open stays on the old one until you restart it — Lucid corrects for
  that itself and is right either way
- **Network** — a *Network* page covering what NetworkManager can do. Wi-Fi
  radio, a live network list grouped into connected, saved and nearby, with a
  filter, a scan you can stop, per-network join with password, forget and
  join-automatically, and a form for hidden networks. Below that: wired devices
  with link speed, VPN and WireGuard profiles to connect and disconnect, a
  Wi-Fi hotspot to share the connection, and every saved profile with its
  autoconnect switch. Each device also gets its addressing — IPv4, IPv6,
  gateway, DNS, MAC, MTU, link rate — and an **IP configuration** editor that
  switches between DHCP and a hand-set address, gateway and DNS, or just
  overrides DNS while leaving the rest automatic. Scriptable with
  `qs ipc call network status | list | rescan`
- **Sound** — a *Sound* page for what plays and what listens. Every output and
  every input the machine has, each one named, with what it is doing right now
  — its mode and the socket the sound comes out of — and a tick on the one in
  use. Click another and it takes over; anything already playing moves across
  with it, which is the part that is usually missing. Open a device for its own
  volume, its **socket** — speakers, the headphone jack, the digital output,
  with the unplugged ones said to be unplugged — and its **mode**, the card
  profile that decides what devices it offers at all. Below that, everything
  making or taking sound right now: a volume and a mute of its own per program,
  and a device of its own, so one application can play somewhere else while the
  rest stay put. A visualiser or a screen recorder sitting on a monitor is left
  where it is rather than dragged onto a microphone. It reads PipeWire directly
  and hears about changes as they happen, so it agrees with `pavucontrol` and
  with whatever else you use. Scriptable with `qs ipc call settings sound`
- **Bluetooth** — a *Bluetooth* page in Settings is a full manager: the radio,
  discoverability, whether the machine accepts pairing requests, and the name
  other devices see. Below it every device the adapter knows, grouped into
  connected, paired and available, with a filter, a scan that stops itself
  after a minute, and per device: connect, pair, forget, rename, auto-reconnect,
  allow-wake, block, and battery where the device reports it. A connected pair
  of headphones also gets its **audio mode** — high quality versus headset,
  whichever profiles PipeWire offers for it — so switching to the microphone
  no longer means a trip to `pavucontrol`
- **Phone** — a *Phone* page that is a real KDE Connect client, not a launcher
  for someone else's. It drives the KDE Connect daemon over D-Bus, so it pairs,
  unpairs and answers pairing requests with the verification key shown on both
  sides. Open a connected device and you get: **send files** through the
  desktop's own file chooser, send text or a link, ring it, lock it, mount and
  browse its storage, send your clipboard, run the commands you set up on it,
  its **notifications** with dismiss and inline reply, a **media remote** with
  seek and volume for whichever player it is running, **its** system volume,
  and a **touchpad and keyboard** that drive the phone from this machine. Every
  per-device feature can be switched off individually. Scriptable too —
  `qs ipc call kdeconnect status`, `list`, `rescan`, and
  `qs ipc call -- kdeconnect ring <id>`
- **Idle and sleep** — an *Idle* page that owns hypridle for you. It writes
  `~/.config/hypr/hypridle.conf` and restarts the daemon whenever something on
  the page changes, so the ladder — dim, lock, screen off, suspend — is set with
  sliders rather than by hand. A rail at the top of the page shows the sequence
  in the order it actually fires and warns when two steps are out of turn.
  Extras worth knowing: **keep awake**, a caffeine toggle that holds every step
  until you turn it off; **never interrupt something playing**, which asks
  playerctl before each step; a suspend that can be limited to battery only; and
  lock-before-sleep plus wake-the-screen-on-resume. Whatever was in your
  hypridle.conf first is read into the page once and copied to
  `hypridle.conf.pre-lucid`, so nothing is lost. Scriptable with
  `qs ipc call idle status | keepawake | on | off | restart`
- **Environment** — an *Environment* page that owns the desktop's appearance
  outside the shell. Cursor theme, size and shadow, icon theme, GTK theme,
  light or dark, the Qt style, and the interface, application, document and
  monospace fonts. *Pointer shadow* has no compositor switch behind it — the
  shade is painted into the cursor theme's own images — so turning it off
  renders the theme again from its vector sources into
  `~/.local/share/icons/<theme>-noshadow`, copying the original's sizes,
  hotspots and frame delays exactly, and points everything at that copy.
  The point is that one choice reaches everywhere: each change is written
  to GTK 2, 3 and 4, to `gsettings`, to the XCursor fallback theme, to
  qt5ct and qt6ct, and to Hyprland's env module, and `hyprctl setcursor` runs
  so the pointer changes under your hand rather than at the next login. The dock
  picks a new icon theme up the moment you choose it — Qt only reads the icon
  theme when a process starts, so Lucid walks the theme directories itself. Only
  the keys Lucid owns are touched — every comment and every other setting in
  those files stays where it was, and a toolkit this machine does not use is
  skipped rather than conjured. It starts by reading what the machine already
  says, so opening the page changes nothing; **Re-read from the system** picks
  those values up again after you have changed appearance with another tool.
  Turn GTK, Qt or Hyprland off individually if you would rather keep one of
  them by hand. Scriptable with `qs ipc call settings environment`
- **Displays** — a *Displays* page for the screens themselves: resolution,
  refresh rate, scale, orientation and adaptive sync, one card per output, which
  names the panel and its size and says what it is doing right now. Only modes
  the display actually reports are offered, so there is no picking one it cannot
  show, and each scale is labelled with the room it leaves for windows — with a
  word of warning on the ones that do not divide the panel evenly. More than one
  screen adds an arrangement you drag: displays snap to their neighbours' edges
  so the pointer has no gaps to fall into, and moving one pins them all where
  they already are rather than letting Hyprland shuffle the rest. A display can
  mirror another or be switched off, except the last one left on, which neither
  the page nor the Hyprland module will let go. The shell itself — the bar, the
  dock, the volume popup and the toasts — sits on whichever display you pick,
  and widgets with no display of their own follow it; the bar and the dock can
  each be sent to a display of their own if you would rather have them apart.
  The wallpaper and the desktop menu are drawn on all of them either way, and
  so is the lock screen — though only the display the shell is on carries the
  password field; the rest show the clock. Unplug the
  display it was pinned to and it moves to one that is left, without losing the
  pick, so plugging back in puts it back. It all becomes monitor rules in
  `~/.config/hypr/lucid-monitors.lua`, applied without a reload, and a display is
  keyed by its description rather than its port, so moving the cable keeps what
  you set. Scriptable with `qs ipc call settings displays`, and the display the
  shell sits on with `qs ipc call -- displays shell <name|here|next|auto>` —
  worth a keybind if you move between screens
- **Glass** — a *Glass* page holding one slider for how far the desktop shows
  through what is in front of it, and a readout of where that lands. Three
  surfaces follow it, each as far as it can take: the shell's own panels, kitty
  — whose `background_opacity` leaves the text alone, so it can go all the way —
  and app windows, a quarter as far, because Hyprland fades a window's text
  along with its background. Any installed app can be frosted on its own, and
  anything else you have open can be added by its window class. Per-app values
  become Hyprland window rules in `~/.config/hypr/lucid-glass.lua`, applied
  without a reload and pushed onto windows that are already open. Scriptable
  with `qs ipc call settings glass`
- **Settings** — a GUI for all of the above, no config file editing. Seventeen
  pages behind a collapsible rail, grouped-list cards, an app bar that collapses
  as you scroll, and a reset arrow on anything you have moved off its default

<img src="assets/prev6.webp" alt="The Lucid lock screen: a large clock on the left, and the sign-in card, the song playing and notifications on the right">

*The lock screen — the clock in the wallpaper's own colour, the weather,
battery, network and Bluetooth at a glance, what is playing, the notifications,
and the power bar in the corner.*

<img src="assets/prev3.webp" alt="The Lucid settings app on the General page">

*Settings on the General page — the shape of the bar and the dock, glass, and
how strongly the accent and the surfaces are tinted. The rail groups the pages
into Appearance, Desktop and Devices.*

## Theming

Colours come from one of seven palettes, picked in Settings or via the
launcher's Theme mode:

**Matugen** and **Pywal** generate a palette from your current wallpaper.
**Catppuccin Mocha**, **Gruvbox**, **Nightfox**, **Nord** and **Tokyo Night**
are fixed palettes that don't change with the wallpaper. Anything you import
sits alongside them, and the whole list can be dragged into the order you want.

Every palette has a light mode too — **Light or dark** on the Theme page.
Matugen and Pywal re-extract the wallpaper in the mode you pick; the fixed
palettes get a light version built from their own colours, so Nord lands on its
own Snow Storm and Gruvbox on its own cream. Light surfaces carry a trace of the
accent, and *Accent tint* on the General page sets how much. The mode is
remembered beside the theme, and GTK and Qt applications follow it, switching to
the light or dark counterpart of their theme where one is installed.

<img src="assets/prev7.webp" alt="Lucid in light mode: pale green widgets, bar and dock over a night-time street">

*Light mode, with the palette taken from the wallpaper. The bar, the dock and
every widget follow it.*

Whichever is active, the shell reads `~/.cache/quickshell/matugen.json` — a
flat map of Material 3 colour roles. Changing your wallpaper through Lucid
runs `~/.config/hypr/scripts/wallpaper/set-wallpaper.sh`, which sets the
wallpaper and then regenerates that file if the active theme is wallpaper-derived.

Every display gets the same picture, cropped to fill. To treat one differently —
a portrait screen that should letterbox rather than crop, or a second screen
with a picture of its own — put a rule in `~/.config/lucid/wallpaper-outputs.conf`,
one output a line:

```
DP-3      --resize fit --fill-color 000000
HDMI-A-1  ~/Pictures/wallpapers/second.jpg
```

Any argument that is a file becomes that output's picture; the rest is passed to
`awww`/`swww`. Outputs with no rule keep the wallpaper you picked, and colours
are still generated from that one. `qs ipc call displays list` prints your
outputs, left to right.

If you already use matugen, the installer **appends** its Quickshell template
to your `config.toml` and backs up the original — your existing templates are
left alone.

### Adding your own theme

**Settings → Theme** takes the URL of any colour-scheme repo, clones it, reads
it, and builds a full Material 3 palette out of what it finds. Scheme repos
agree on no common format, so detection is tiered: base16 and base24 YAML and
name-keyed JSON (Catppuccin and friends) are read exactly, and anything else
falls back to harvesting hex codes and sorting them by tone and chroma. A repo
carrying several variants lists them so you can pick one, and wallpapers in the
repo come along with it.

Nothing from the repo is ever executed — only text is parsed and only images
are copied.

It writes `~/.config/lucid/themes/<id>/{quickshell.json,meta.json}` and
`~/Pictures/wallpapers/<id>/`, which you can also do by hand: a
`quickshell.json` with the same keys as the bundled palettes is all a theme is.
The importer runs from a terminal too:

```sh
python3 ~/.config/lucid/add-theme.py <repo-url> [--list] [--variant <name>] [--name <label>]
```

## Requirements

Arch Linux or Fedora, with Hyprland. The installer handles the packages below, so
you know what's being pulled in.

**Required** — the shell won't start without these:

Arch: `quickshell` · `qt6-5compat` · `qt6-declarative` · `qt6-multimedia`

Fedora: `quickshell` · `qt6-qt5compat` · `qt6-qtdeclarative` · `qt6-qtmultimedia`

The package names below are for Arch; the installer uses Fedora equivalents
where available (for example `python3-gobject`, `kde-connect`,
`pulseaudio-utils`, and `google-noto-color-emoji-fonts`).

**Per feature** — a missing one breaks only its own feature:

| Package | Backs |
| --- | --- |
| `matugen`, `jq` | Wallpaper-derived colours, theme switching |
| `git` | Importing a theme from a scheme repo on Settings → Theme |
| `awww` | Setting the wallpaper |
| `python-pywal` | The Pywal theme |
| `networkmanager` | Wi-Fi panel |
| `bluez`, `bluez-utils` | Bluetooth panel and the Bluetooth settings page |
| `kdeconnect`, `python-gobject` | The KDE Connect page. The daemon is the backend and starts itself; `python-gobject` backs the bridge Lucid talks to it through. Without either the page says so and does nothing else |
| `libpulse`, `wireplumber` | Volume, audio devices |
| `brightnessctl`, `upower` | Brightness, battery |
| `hypridle` | The Idle page: dimming, locking, screen off and suspend when you walk away. Without it the page says so and writes nothing |
| `grim`, `wf-recorder`, `ffmpeg`, `imagemagick` | Screenshots and recording |
| `tesseract`, `tesseract-data-eng` | The Text mode's OCR. Without them Text mode says so and copies nothing. Add `tesseract-data-<lang>` and set `ocrLang` in `lucidshot/Screenshot.qml` for another language |
| `python-pillow`, `python-numpy`, `python-fonttools` | Emoji in copied text. Without them the text still copies, minus the emoji. The glyph atlas is built once and cached in `~/.cache/lucidshot-ocr`; `lucidshot/emoji-ocr.py --atlas` builds it up front so the first copy is not slow |
| `wl-clipboard`, `wtype` | Emoji and GIF pasting |
| `cliphist` | Clipboard history. Without it the launcher's Clipboard mode says so and the Dock page's switch is greyed out |
| `cava` | Audio visualisers — the media panel's strip (its config is installed to `~/.config/cava/quickshell.conf`; the strip needs that file's raw-ascii output settings) and the desktop widget, which writes its own `~/.cache/quickshell/lucid-cava.conf` at whatever band count the widest card asks for |
| `songrec` | Song identification |
| `curl` | Weather, location lookup and GIF search |
| `polkit` | Every administrator prompt. The shell registers itself as the session's authentication agent and drives polkit's own setuid helper, so no separate agent is needed — and no other agent should be started, as only one can hold the session |
| `accountsservice` | The Users and Accounts page. Every change goes through it, so the shell's own polkit dialog asks and nothing runs as root |
| `libnotify` | Notification actions |
| `swappy` | The "Open" action on a screenshot notification |
| `hyprpicker` | The Colour mode. Without it the mode says so and picks nothing |
| `xdg-utils` | Opening links and files from the shell |
| `librsvg` | Turning the pointer's shadow off — the cursor theme is rendered again from its vector sources |
| `noto-fonts-emoji` | Emoji rendering |

**The Hyprland config and the look** — installed unless you pass `--no-hypr`
or `--no-look`. The binds shell out to these, so a missing one is a dead key:

| Package | Backs |
| --- | --- |
| `kitty` | Terminal (`F9`), and the themed terminal colours |
| `fish` | The shell kitty opens |
| `nautilus` | Files (`SUPER`+`E`) |
| `playerctl` | The media keys |
| `gnome-calculator` | Calculator (`F12`) |
| `starship` | The prompt |
| `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` | The glyphs the prompt and kitty are drawn with |
| `adw-gtk-theme` | Provides `adw-gtk3-dark`, the GTK theme Lucid selects |
| `papirus-icon-theme` | Fallback icons — FairyWren declares `Inherits=Papirus` |

**The dock's default pins** — installed unless you pass `--no-apps`. Several
GB, mostly from the AUR:

`zen-browser-bin` · `vscodium-bin` · `spotify` · `vesktop` · `nautilus` ·
`steam` · `proton-vpn-gtk-app`

Anything you already have an equivalent of is left alone — `vscodium` counts
for `vscodium-bin`, `discord` for `vesktop`, and so on. `steam` is skipped
unless the `multilib` repo is enabled on Arch. Fedora installs only dock RPMs
available from enabled repositories; unavailable apps are listed and skipped.

Lucid uses Hyprland-specific APIs for workspaces and window management. It
will not work on other compositors.

### Fonts

The default UI font is **Google Sans**, which is not in the Arch repos. If you
don't have it, Qt falls back to your default sans and everything still works —
or pick any installed font in Settings → General.

## Optional setup

**GIF search** needs a free Giphy key (email only, no card) from
[developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/). Put it in
`~/.config/quickshell/lucidmoji/config.json`:

```json
{ "giphyKey": "your-key-here", "tenorKey": "", "gifDir": "" }
```

Tenor works too if you'd rather use that. Emoji and kaomoji need no key.

**Wallpapers** default to `~/Pictures/wallpapers`, one folder per theme —
`~/Pictures/wallpapers/gruvbox` is what the strip shows while you are on
Gruvbox. The installer puts a set in each of them, skipping any file you already
have, and `--no-wallpapers` leaves the folder alone entirely. Change the folder
in Settings → General, which then applies to every theme.

## IPC reference

Every surface is scriptable. `qs ipc call -- <target> <function> [arg]`:

| Target | Functions |
| --- | --- |
| `launcher` | `toggle` `open` `close` `wallpaper` `theme` `power` `blur` `command` `shuffle` `clipboard` `search <query>` |
| `settings` | `toggle` `open` `close` `show <page>` `general` `users` `glass` `bar` `dock` `environment` `displays` `widgets` `workspaces` `notifications` `sound` `network` `bluetooth` `kdeconnect` `idle` `datetime` `font` `reset` |
| `idle` | `status` `keepawake` `awake` `normal` `on` `off` `restart` |
| `network` | `status` `list` `rescan` |
| `kdeconnect` | `status` `list` `rescan` `ring <id>` `ping <id>` `clipboard <id>` `files <id>` `send <id> <path>` |
| `widgets` | `add <type> <variant>` `remove <uid>` `clear` `toggle` `lock` `unlock` `list` `catalogue` `settings` `resize <uid> <w> <h>` |
| `moji` | `toggle` `open` `close` `emoji` `kaomoji` `gif` `center` |
| `keyboard` | `toggle` `open` `close` `letters` `fnkeys` `center` `bigger` `smaller` |
| `notifs` | `toggle` `open` `close` `clear` `toggleDnd` `expandAll` `settings` `count` |
| `lock` | `lock` `unlock` `isLocked` `status` — nothing here bypasses the password; PAM is the only way in |
| `snap` | `toggle` `open` `close` `text` `color` |
| `toast` | `show <icon> <label>` `warn <icon> <label>` |
| `screenshot` | `full` `text` |
| `media` | `toggle` `open` `close` `identify` `playPause` `next` `previous` |
| `workspaces` | `toggle` `open` `close` |
| `updates` | `status` `check` |
| `displays` | `list` `settings` `shell <where>` `bar <where>` `dock <where>` — *where* is an output name, `left`/`middle`/`right`, `here`, `next`, `prev` or `auto` |
| `polkit` | `status` `demo <action-id>` `fail` `grant` `close` — `demo` raises the dialog with no PAM session behind it, for previewing a theme |
| `debug` | `toggle` `on` `off` — draws input and blur region outlines |

## Uninstall

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Moves `~/.config/quickshell` aside rather than deleting it, so your settings
survive. Packages installed by `install.sh` are left alone. It prints what else
it left in place — the matugen template blocks, `~/.config/hypr`,
`starship.toml` and its init lines in your rc files, kitty's colour and
opacity includes — each with a timestamped backup beside it, so you can undo
them by hand.

## Troubleshooting

**The media popup's visualiser sits flat and never moves.**
cava is running without `~/.config/cava/quickshell.conf` — its own defaults emit
ncurses output rather than the raw ascii frames the strip parses, so there is
nothing to draw. Re-run the installer, or copy `support/cava/quickshell.conf`
there yourself. Before v1.0.0 this showed as one enormous bar covering the
popup instead.

**Another app's notifications show instead of Lucid's.**
`org.freedesktop.Notifications` is a single-owner D-Bus name. Lucid's bar
serves it, but any other notification daemon that is merely *installed* —
swaync, dunst, mako — gets D-Bus-activated by the first notification and then
keeps the name for the whole session. It does not need to be autostarted to
win. Check who holds it:

```sh
busctl --user status org.freedesktop.Notifications | grep PID
```

If that is not `quickshell`, mask the daemon and log back in:

```sh
systemctl --user mask swaync.service   # or dunst.service, mako.service
pkill swaync
```

The installer offers to do this for you.


**GTK apps are light, or their icons are wrong.**
Under Hyprland there is no xsettings daemon, so GTK3/GTK4 read
`~/.config/gtk-{3,4}.0/settings.ini` while GNOME apps and portals read
`gsettings`. The installer writes both. If only some apps changed, check they
agree:

```sh
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme    # adw-gtk3-dark
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme   # FairyWren_Dark
grep -E 'theme-name' ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
```

The icons live in `~/.local/share/icons/FairyWren_Dark`. If that directory is
missing the installer could not reach GitLab — clone it by hand from
`https://gitlab.com/FreshDoctor/FairyWren-Icons`.

**Nothing appears when I run `qs`.** Check `qs log` for QML errors, and
confirm you're on Hyprland — Lucid needs its Wayland protocols.

**Everything is grey / colours look wrong.** The palette cache is missing or
empty. Set a wallpaper through Settings → General, or copy a bundled palette:
`cp ~/.config/lucid/themes/nord/quickshell.json ~/.cache/quickshell/matugen.json`

**The blur frosts my windows instead of the desktop.** Hyprland's blur samples
whatever is behind the layer. Add to `hyprland.conf`:

```
layerrule = xray 1, quickshell
```

**Icons look blurry.** A fractional `monitor` scale factor puts icons on
fractional pixels. Use an integer scale, or adjust the icon size in Settings.

**Animations feel choppy on an NVIDIA card, even at 144Hz or higher.** Qt's
Wayland plugin refuses threaded OpenGL on the proprietary NVIDIA driver — that
is its workaround for [QTBUG-95817](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-95817)
— so Qt Quick falls back to the basic render loop, whose animation driver is a
fixed ~16ms timer with no vsync awareness. Every animation in the shell is then
pinned to ~60fps however fast the monitor runs, which is why Hyprland stays
smooth while Lucid does not.

Lucid starts through `~/.config/lucid/launch-shell.sh`, which moves those
machines to Qt's Vulkan backend — Vulkan carries no such vendor check, so the
threaded loop and its vsync-driven animations come back. Ask it what it decided:

```sh
~/.config/lucid/launch-shell.sh --explain
```

It only switches when NVIDIA is the GPU the compositor actually renders on, the
driver is 555 or newer, and an NVIDIA Vulkan driver is present. Mesa already
gets the threaded loop and is left alone. Override the detection with
`LUCID_RHI_BACKEND=vulkan` or `LUCID_RHI_BACKEND=opengl`; an existing
`QSG_RHI_BACKEND` in your environment always wins.

**A keybind with an argument does nothing.** Add `--` before the target:
`qs ipc call -- settings show bar`. Without it `qs` parses the argument as its
own and refuses the call. Argument-free calls work either way.

Issues and PRs welcome. If you're reporting a bug, `qs log` output and your
Hyprland version help a lot.

## The mark

<img src="assets/logo-mark.svg" width="64" align="left" alt="The Lucida mark">

The logo is **Lucida** — the astronomical term for the brightest star in a
constellation, sharing its Latin root (*lux*) with "Lucid". A broken orbit ring,
a four-point star at the centre, and one companion dot outside the gap.

Its official colour is **coral `#FF7F50`**. In the shell itself the ring and the
companion dot track your accent, so the mark on the dock launcher recolours with
whatever palette you are running — but coral is the canonical brand colour, and
what you see above.

<br clear="left">

`assets/logo.svg` is the mark on its dark plate; `assets/logo-mark.svg` is the
bare coral mark for light and dark backgrounds alike. Both are drawn from the
same 24×24 geometry as [`LucidaMark.qml`](lucidprefs/LucidaMark.qml).
