# sync-sddm.sh [--check] [palette.json]
#
# paints the active SDDM theme from the palette Lucid last applied. sddm runs
# before anyone logs in, so it cannot read a per-user palette - the colours
# have to live in the theme itself.
#
# two modes:
#
#   lucid   the active theme is Lucid's own. every token is read off the
#           RUNNING shell (theme-dump.qml), because Theme.qml derives its
#           colours in L* tone space and that is not reproducible from the
#           palette file alone. the wallpaper is copied in and pre-blurred.
#
#   generic any other theme. rewrites any key whose value is ALREADY a hex
#           colour and whose name reads as an accent, a background or a
#           foreground. the hex check is the safety net: a wallpaper path, a
#           font name or a number is never touched.
#
# --check reports what would happen and writes nothing. it prints one of:
#   ok lucid <theme>  the Lucid theme is installed and writable
#   ok <theme>        another theme, writable, will follow the palette
#   readonly <path>   the theme exists but is not writable by this user
#   notheme           sddm is not configured, or its theme has no theme.conf
#   nopalette         Lucid has not written a palette yet
